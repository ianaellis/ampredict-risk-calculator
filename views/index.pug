				font(size='+2') Ampredict Development and Validation
			font(size='4.5rem')
				p AMPREDICT mortality and reamputation prediction models, which inform the AMPREDICT Risk Calculator, were developed in a national sample of over 5,000 veterans undergoing their first major (transmetatarsal, transtibial, or transfemoral) dysvascular lower extremity amputation; the mobility prediction model was developed prospectively on a cohort of over 200 amputees. Details of the development and validation of the prediction models can be seen in the following
